# Deploying Toto Microservices on ECS Fargate
This pattern consists in deploying **Toto Microservices** on AWS, using ECS Fagrate as a serverless container engine. <br>
This pattern is based on the following architecture:

## 1. Implementing the Pattern
To implement this pattern, I have setup two example Microservices, one in Python and one in NodeJS. These are the Github repos with the code of those two microservices: 
* [Python Microservice Github Repo](https://github.com/nicolasances/aws-py-service)
* TBD for NodeJS Microservice

### 1.1. Setup ECR and a Github Action workflow
The first step to deploy those Toto microservices to AWS, is to **Setup ECR** and a **Github Action** to build and deploy the container image to ECR. 

The following steps are needed: 
 * **Create the Github Actions YAML**. A working example is found in the example microservices under `.github/workflows/release-dev.yml`. 
 * **Create an ECR repo**. A repo needs to be created on ECR **before** being able to push to it. 

To **create an ECR Repo**: 
 * Go on AWS portal, in ECR, Private Repositories and **Create a Repository**. 
 * Give a name to the repo, and you're done!

### 1.2. Create a VPC, Public Subnet, IGW
Creating a VPC and Subnet are straightfoward. 

The Internet Gateway is needed to make the subnet public. 
* The following guide goes through the steps: [Configure a IGW to make a Subnet Public](../making-subnet-public.md)

### 1.3. Create a Task Definition in ECS

### 1.4. Create an ECS Cluster

### 1.5. Deploy an ECS Service 

### 1.6. Create a Load Balancer and configure Listener and Rules
The next step is to create an **Application** Load Balancer, a single one to put in front of all the ECS microservices, and configure it so that based on the request it directs the call to the right microservice.

* The following guide goes through the steps of creating a Load Balancer: [Using a Load Balancer with ECS Fargate](../load-balancer-ecs.md)
* The following guide goes through the steps of configuring multiple services behind a single ALB: [Configuring multiple ECS Services under a single ALB](../alb-multiple-ecs-services.md)

### 1.7. Configure your Domain with Route 53
The next step is to configure a subdomain of your acquired domain to route to the Load Balancer. 

* The following guide goes through the steps: [Configuring your own domain with ALB and Route 53](../own-domain-name-alb.md)

### 1.8. Configure required Secrets on AWS Secrets Manager
The final step is to create the necessary secrets under AWS SM. <br>
In Version v1.1 of the Toto API Controller (check the documentation [here, on its repo for Python](https://github.com/nicolasances/py-toto-api-controller/blob/main/docs/v1.1.md)), there is only **one secret** that needs to be configured: `jwt-signing-key`. <br>
That requires that you create a secret with key `{environment}/jwt-signing-key` where `environment` is provided by the `ENVIRONMENT` env variable that is set in the container.

* The following guide goes through the steps of configuring a secret: [Configure secrets on AWS Secrets Manager](../managing-secrets.md)
